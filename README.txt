This "library" tries to make the process of writing irc client programs
easier. it is not designed to be comperhensive, but rather designed to be
easily expandable. it was originally written for an irc game bot and that 
required very little and basic usage of the irc protocol. but you can easily 
add more funcitonality to it, if you need to.

see examples/echo_bot.c for details of how to use the library
see irc.c and irc.h for details of how to expand the library 
see net.h if you need to port libirc to other platforms/networking APIs
