This "library" tries to make the process of writing irc client programs easier.
it is not designed to be comperhensive, but rather designed to be easily expandable.
it was originally written for an irc game bot and that  required very little and basic 
usage of the irc protocol, and its development stopped there. but you can easily add more
funcitonality to it, if you need to.
